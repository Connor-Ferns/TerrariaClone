Terraria-Like Clone Project
üåç A 2D sandbox adventure game inspired by Terraria, created as a learning project by a beginner game developer.

Disclaimer: This project is made by someone still learning game development concepts. You'll likely find unconventional approaches, inefficient code, and "the long way around" solutions. I'm sharing this journey openly - feedback and patience are appreciated! üòä

Features (Planned/In Development)
Procedural World Generation (basic 2D terrain with dirt, stone, and ores)

Tile-Based System (destructible/placeable blocks)

Basic Player Mechanics (movement, jumping, simple combat)

Simple Enemy AI (basic mobs with patrol/attack behaviors)

Inventory System (item collection and basic crafting)

Day/Night Cycle (basic lighting changes and time progression)

Controls
Movement: Arrow Keys / WASD

Jump: Spacebar

Attack: Left Click

Place Blocks: Right Click

Inventory: E key

Crafting Menu: C key

Contributing
While this is primarily a learning project, I welcome:

Suggestions for improvement

Code optimizations (with explanations for my learning!)

Art/audio contributions

Please open an issue first to discuss any major changes.

Beginner's Note
‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up for experienced devs:
This project contains code written by someone still grasping fundamental concepts. You might encounter:

Overcomplicated solutions to simple problems

"Spaghetti code" moments

Inefficient algorithms

Reinvented wheels

Awkward class structures

I'm learning through doing, and documenting my progress. Your constructive feedback is welcome!
